In the paper P3DTerr, the authors present a framework for generation 3D scenery at random. To accomplish this, the authors use a P generator to get a RGB image, then a G conditional generator to get the depth map from RGB image.


# Steps needed to get this project of the ground

1. Generate a larger dataset, like the one described by the authors.
    - Get access to the ALOS World 3D - 30m (AW3D30)
    - Get GeoJSON polygon and feed to google earth engine API
    - The tile are shaped 256 x 256
    - Depth is scaled to range [-1,1] according to global minimum-maximum of the dataset. (Maybe using standardization could be more useful)

2. GAN for Satellite Image Generation
    - A novel method called ProGAN is used, which allows for progressive training of the layers.
